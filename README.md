### What is Logidrone?
Logidrone is a tool for converting [Logisim] circuits to [Nimbatus] drones.

Currently the plan is for these to be simple circuits with only maybe a few dozen gates at most.

### How to use
Instructions for converting files will be posted when we figure that out. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
